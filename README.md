Live notification on achievement unlocking
==========================================

Not as sexy as a directX Overlay but it's the next best thing.<br />
Display a Windows toast notification when you unlock an achievement.<br />
**Please verify your notification and focus assistant settings for this to work properly**.<br />

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/xan105/Achievement-Watcher/raw/master/screenshot/live.gif">
</p>

You can disable this feature in the settings section.<br />

Note that there might be a slight delay between the event and the display of the notification as running powershell and loading a remote img resource can take a few seconds in some cases.<br />

Game must be set to Window borderless for the notification to be rendered on top of it otherwise you'll just here the sound.<br />

ðŸš‘ Not seeing any notification ? Quick fix :
- try to set your game to Window borderless.
- try to disable the automatic game rule in focus assistant
- try to set checkIfProcessIsRunning to false in `%appdata%/achievement-watcher/options.ini`

Oh and make sure `watchdog.exe` is running.<br />
<br />
Not all games are supported, please see below.<br />

Steam Web API Key

Some use of the Steam Web API to fetch data from Steam requires the use of an API Key.<br />
If you leave the field blank in the settings section, it will automagically fetch said data.<br />

<p align="center">

</p>

An example of a server that feeds you the data is provided within this repo.<br />
This service is not guarantee over time and is solely provided for your own convenience.<br />
If you experience any issues please use your own Steam Web API key.<br />              
                
You can acquire one [by filling out this form](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).<br />
Use of the APIs also requires that you agree to the [Steam API Terms of Use](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apiterms).<br />

Options
=======
Options are stored in ```%AppData%\Roaming\achievement-watcher\cfg\options.ini```<br />

[achievement]
- lang<br />
  default to user locale<br />
  Both UI and data from Steam<br />
- showHidden<br />
  default to false<br />
  Wether or not show hidden achievements if any<br />
- mergeDuplicate<br />
  default to true<br />
  Try to merge multiple achievement files with the same steam appid<br />
- notification<br />
  default to true<br />
  Display or not a Windows toast notification on achievement unlocking. <br />
  (`AchievementWatcher.exe` doesn't need to be running for this, but `watchdogd.exe` does).<br />
  
[notifier]
- timeTreshold<br />
  default to 30 sec<br />
  When an achievement file is modified; Amount of sec `watchdogd.exe` will consider the most recent achieved achievement (from its timestamp value) to be new.<br />

- checkIfProcessIsRunning<br />
  default to true<br />
  When an achievement file is modified; Wether to check or not if the corresponding game is running and responding.<br />
  <br />
  Both options are mainly there to mitigate false positive.

Command Line Args | URI Scheme
==============================

Args:<br />
`--appid xxxxx `<br />

URI:<br />
`ach:xxxx`<br />

xxx is a steam appid<br />

After the loading directly display the specified game.<br />
                    
Windows compatibility
=====================
Windows x64 only.<br />
Windows 10 >= 1809 is recommended.<br />

It should work starting with Windows 8 and above but keep in mind that this was mostly tested with Windows 10.<br />

Translation Help
================

I do my best to translate everything for every supported language by Steam, but it's rather difficult and I don't speak that much languages.
Fluent in another language ? Any help to add/modify/improve would be greatly appreciated.
