Some steam emulator generate a text file where all the achievements you have unlocked are stored.
But they aren't very friendly to know which is which, here is an example :
```ini
[NEW_ACHIEVEMENT_1_1]
Achieved=1
CurProgress=0
MaxProgress=0
UnlockTime=0000000000
[SteamAchievements]
00000=NEW_ACHIEVEMENT_1_1
Count=1
```
So which achievement is NEW_ACHIEVEMENT_1_1 ? You'll have to ask the steam API or look online in a site like the steamdb to find out.
So let's just do that automagically :)

Live notification on achievement unlocking
==========================================

Not as sexy as a directX Overlay but it's the next best thing.<br />
Display a Windows toast notification when you unlock an achievement.<br />
**Please verify your notification and focus assistant settings for this to work properly**.<br />

<p align="center">

</p>

You can disable this feature in the settings section.<br />

Note that there might be a slight delay between the event and the display of the notification as running powershell and loading a remote img resource can take a few seconds in some cases.<br />

Game must be set to Window borderless for the notification to be rendered on top of it otherwise you'll just here the sound.<br />

üöë Not seeing any notification ? Quick fix :
- try to set your game to Window borderless.
- try to disable the automatic game rule in focus assistant
- try to set checkIfProcessIsRunning to false in `%appdata%/Achievement Watcher/options.ini`

Oh and make sure `watchdog.exe` is running.<br />
<br />
Not all games are supported, please see below.<br />
  
Compatibility :
================

**From file:**<br/>

|Steam Emulator|Unlock Time|Ach Progress|Notification|File|
|--------------|-----------|------------|------------|----|
|Codex| Yes | No (always set to zero by emu) | Yes | achievements.ini |
|RLD!| No (Unknow hex time) | No (always set to zero by emu) | No | stats\achievements.ini |
|Skidrow| No | No | No | achieve.dat |
|ALI213| Yes | No | No | achievements.bin |

By default the following location will be scanned for the above steam emu file :
```
- %PUBLIC%\Documents\Steam\CODEX
- %appdata%\Steam\CODEX
- %ProgramData%\Steam\*\
- %localappdata%\SKIDROW
- %appdata%\SmartSteamEmu
```

Will be scanned too altho there is no achievement file yet at the time of writing :
```
- Documents\CPY_SAVES\*\
- %appdata%\CPY_SAVES\*\
- %appdata%\Goldberg SteamEmu Saves
```

You can add your own folder in the app, just make sure that you select a folder which contains appid folder(s) :<br/>
 ```
 |___ Custom dir
      |___ 480 
      |___ 220 
 ```
For ALI213 there is no default folder so choose the dir where the `AlI213.ini` file is; <br>
The app will then parse it and look for `\Profile\[EMUUSERNAME]\Stats\achievements.bin` from the chosen location.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that notification only works with CODEX emu file,<br/>
by default in `%PUBLIC%\Documents\Steam\CODEX` but you can add other location in the app.

**From Registry:**<br/>

|Steam Emulator|Unlock Time|Ach Progress|Notification|Location|
|--------------|-----------|------------|------------|----|
|Green Luma Reborn| No | No | No | HKCU\SOFTWARE\GLR\AppID\[APPID] |

‚ö†Ô∏è Parse GLR ach for APPID only if the reg key "SkipStatsAndAchievements" is set to dword:00000000.

Steam Web API Key
=================
Some use of the Steam Web API to fetch data from Steam requires the use of an API Key.<br />
If you leave the field blank in the settings section, it will automagically fetch said data.<br />

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/xan105/Achievement-Watcher/raw/master/screenshot/settings.png" width="600px">
</p>

An example of a server that feeds you the data is provided within this repo.<br />
This service is not guarantee over time and is solely provided for your own convenience.<br />
If you experience any issues please use your own Steam Web API key.<br />              
                
You can acquire one [by filling out this form](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).<br />
Use of the APIs also requires that you agree to the [Steam API Terms of Use](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apiterms).<br />

Options

Options are stored in ```%AppData%\Roaming\Achievement Watcher\cfg\options.ini```<br />

[achievement]

  default to user locale<br />
  Both UI and data from Steam<br />
- showHidden<br />
  default to false<br />
  Wether or not show hidden achievements if any<br />

[notifier]
- timeTreshold<br />
  default to 30 sec<br />
  When an achievement file is modified; Amount of sec `watchdog.exe` will consider the most recent achieved achievement (from its timestamp value) to be new.<br />

- checkIfProcessIsRunning<br />
  default to true<br />
  When an achievement file is modified; Wether to check or not if the corresponding game is running and responding.<br />
  <br />
  Both options are mainly there to mitigate false positive.

Command Line Args | URI Scheme
==============================

Args:<br />
`--appid xxxxx `<br />

URI:<br />
`ach:xxxx`<br />

xxx is a steam appid<br />

After the loading directly display the specified game.<br />
                    
Windows compatibility
=====================
Windows x64 only.<br />
Windows 10 >= 1809 is recommended.<br />

It should work starting with Windows 8 and above but keep in mind that this was mostly tested with Windows 10.<br />

Translation Help
================

I do my best to translate everything for every supported language by Steam, but it's rather difficult and I don't speak that much languages.
Fluent in another language ? Any help to add/modify/improve would be greatly appreciated.

===========
